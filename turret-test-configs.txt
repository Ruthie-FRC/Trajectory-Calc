# Turret Trajectory Test Configurations
# Format: robotX,robotY,robotZ,targetX,targetY,targetZ,yawOffset,pitchOffset[,speed,spin]
#
# robotX,robotY,robotZ: Robot position on field (meters)
# targetX,targetY,targetZ: Target position (meters)
# yawOffset: Current turret yaw offset from robot heading (degrees, positive = counterclockwise)
# pitchOffset: Current turret pitch from horizontal (degrees, 0 = horizontal, 90 = vertical)
# speed (optional): Launch speed in m/s (default: 12.0)
# spin (optional): Spin rate in rad/s (default: 200.0)
#
# Note: Turret has 360° rotation in yaw, pitch range typically 0-90° (horizontal to vertical)

# ===== Scenario 1: Robot centered, turret aligned, close target =====
# Robot at origin, turret pointing straight ahead at horizontal
0.0,0.0,0.5,3.0,0.0,2.5,0.0,0.0

# ===== Scenario 2: Robot offset, turret needs adjustment, medium target =====
# Robot at (2,1), turret at 15° left and 10° up, target ahead
2.0,1.0,0.5,7.0,1.0,2.5,15.0,10.0

# ===== Scenario 3: Side shot with turret rotated =====
# Robot at (1,0), turret at 45° right, target to the side
1.0,0.0,0.5,4.0,3.0,2.5,-45.0,0.0

# ===== Scenario 4: Long range with turret pre-elevated =====
# Robot at origin, turret already pitched up 20°, far target
0.0,0.0,0.5,8.0,0.0,2.5,0.0,20.0

# ===== Scenario 5: Close range, turret pointed wrong direction =====
# Need large yaw correction
1.0,1.0,0.5,3.5,1.5,2.5,-30.0,5.0

# ===== Scenario 6: Angled approach from corner =====
# Robot in corner, target in center
-1.0,-1.0,0.5,5.0,2.0,2.5,20.0,0.0

# ===== Scenario 7: Robot moving position, turret tracking =====
# Simulating turret catching up to target
3.0,2.0,0.5,7.0,2.5,2.5,10.0,15.0

# ===== Scenario 8: High target, turret needs significant pitch =====
# Target elevated, turret starting low
2.0,0.0,0.5,5.0,0.0,3.5,0.0,5.0

# ===== Scenario 9: Lateral shot, turret significantly rotated =====
# Large lateral offset
0.0,0.0,0.5,4.0,4.0,2.5,60.0,10.0

# ===== Scenario 10: Long range from back position =====
# Robot far back, shooting forward
-2.0,0.0,0.5,8.0,0.5,2.5,5.0,25.0

# ===== Scenario 11: Different speeds - faster shot =====
# Robot centered, higher launch speed for testing
0.0,0.0,0.5,6.0,0.0,2.5,0.0,0.0,15.0,250.0

# ===== Scenario 12: Different speeds - slower shot =====
# Robot centered, lower launch speed
0.0,0.0,0.5,4.0,0.0,2.5,0.0,0.0,10.0,180.0

# ===== Scenario 13: Behind target angle =====
# Robot past target, shooting back (unusual but possible)
6.0,0.0,0.5,3.0,0.0,2.5,180.0,0.0

# ===== Scenario 14: Extreme lateral with vertical turret orientation =====
# Turret nearly vertical, target to side
1.0,1.0,0.5,5.0,5.0,2.5,45.0,75.0

# ===== Scenario 15: Edge case - minimum distance =====
# Very close shot
0.5,0.0,0.5,2.0,0.0,2.5,0.0,0.0
