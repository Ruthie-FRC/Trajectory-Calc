# TRAJECTORY TEST TARGETS
# ========================================
# This file comes preloaded with comprehensive examples demonstrating all solver capabilities.
# Replace these with your own test scenarios as needed.
#
# FORMAT (each section on separate lines for readability):
#   ROBOT_XY:              x, y (meters on field - shooter height is constant at 0.5m)
#   CURRENT_TURRET_DEGREE: yaw (0-360°, where 0° = robot forward)
#   CURRENT_HOOD_DEGREE:   pitch (0-90°, where 0° = horizontal, 90° = vertical)
#   LAUNCH_PARAMS:         speed, spin (m/s, rad/s) [optional - uses defaults if omitted]
#   ---
#
# TARGET INFORMATION:
#   - Target is ALWAYS at field origin (0, 0) with height 1.83m (HUB front edge)
#   - HUB opening: 41.7in (~1.06m) hexagonal
#   - Shooter height: constant at 0.5m (~half foot from ground)
#
# TURRET ANGLES:
#   - Yaw (CURRENT_TURRET_DEGREE):   0° = robot forward, positive = counterclockwise (full 360° rotation)
#   - Pitch (CURRENT_HOOD_DEGREE):   0° = horizontal, 90° = straight up
#
# OUTPUT WILL INCLUDE:
#   - Turret Change: ±degrees from current position
#   - Hood Change: ±degrees from current position
#   - Spin Type: Backspin/Topspin/Sidespin
#   - Success Probability: 0-100%
#   - Trajectory Confidence: 0-100%
#   - Margin of Error: ±meters
#   - Full non-parabolic trajectory equations (drag, Magnus, spin decay)
#   - Comprehensive trajectory analysis
#
# Lines starting with # are comments and will be ignored.
