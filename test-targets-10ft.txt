# ========================================
# TRAJECTORY TEST TARGETS - 10 FEET RANGE
# ========================================
# This file contains test scenarios within 10 feet (3.048 meters) range.
# Max ball speed: 30 ft/s (9.144 m/s)
# Focus: Accuracy, Precision, Rim Clearance, Center-targeting
#
# FORMAT (each section on separate lines for readability):
#   ROBOT_XY:              x, y (meters on field - shooter height is constant at 0.5m)
#   CURRENT_TURRET_DEGREE: yaw (0-360°, where 0° = robot forward)
#   CURRENT_HOOD_DEGREE:   pitch (0-90°, where 0° = horizontal, 90° = vertical)
#   ---
#
# TARGET INFORMATION:
#   - Target is ALWAYS at field origin (0, 0) with height 1.83m (HUB center)
#   - HUB opening: 41.7in (~1.06m) hexagonal
#   - Shooter height: constant at 0.5m (~half foot from ground)
#   - MUST CLEAR RIM vertically and aim for CENTER of target
#
# Lines starting with # are comments and will be ignored.
